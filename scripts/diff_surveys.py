"""Compare two survey runs and report what changed.

Reads the raw crawl *.jsonl files in a previous and a current survey directory
(derived files — new_items.jsonl, verified.jsonl — are skipped, and so is any
record that lacks the crawler fields) and classifies:

  new              — announcements that appeared since the previous run
  closed           — announcements that disappeared (deadline passed / pulled)
  deadline_changed — same announcement, different deadline (extension etc.)
  unchanged        — still open, same deadline (carry over previous verdicts)

Records are keyed by (source, id) so K-Startup and the other sources never
collide. Sources crawled only in one of the two runs are excluded from the
closed/new comparison (a source you didn't re-crawl isn't "all closed") and
reported separately, so coverage mismatches can't masquerade as changes.

Usage:
  python3 diff_surveys.py <prev_dir> <curr_dir> [--out new_items.jsonl]

Output: human-readable summary on stdout; with --out, the new items are
written as jsonl so they can be fed straight to the detail crawlers.
Exit code: 0 on success (even if nothing changed), 1 on bad input.
